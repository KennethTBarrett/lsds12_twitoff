<h2>About Twitoff</h2>

<p>Twitoff is a project in Lambda School's immersive data science program. In this sprint of our data engineering and
  software engineering unit, we're working on deploying our models to web applications. Thus, we have created this Heroku app as a means to learn the
  process using a simple Logistic Regression model we've created, to help users determine which Twitter user would be more likely
  to tweet a certain text defined by the user.</p>

<h3>How To Use Twitoff</h3>
<p>Using Twitoff is simple! Simply enter the username of the specified Twitter user, click 'Add User', then wait for the page to load!
  Do keep in mind that each user needs to be added in individually, with no '@' necessary.You'll then be given a redirect link back to the index,
  where you can compare! Just select each user, then enter the tweet text you'd like to predict and click 'Compare Users'.</p>
